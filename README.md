🎗️What I learned New🎗️ : 

✔️Sunburst Chart: is a type of radial visualization that is ideal for displaying hierarchical data. It is structured in concentric rings, with each level of hierarchy represented by a different ring. The center of the chart represents the root, while the outer rings represent branches or subcategories of data.
✔️Index()Function : returns the value of a cell within a specific range based on the row and column numbers you provide.

✔️Match()Function: find the position of a specific value in a range.
     To combine INDEX with MATCH for dynamic lookups, where MATCH finds the row or column number and INDEX retrieves the corresponding value.
